<p>Visual Studio is a IDE that is very famous among coders. It is a very useful app that most profesional coders use. And best of all, it's free!</p>

<p>Every website has a console screen, you can get to it by pressing control shift i. The console screen is used by coders to check if variables and other things on there website are working. For example, if you have a variable and the value is supposed to be 7. In JS, you can write console.log and then the variable name and in the console it will tell you the variable value.</p>
